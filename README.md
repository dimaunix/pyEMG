**_Chrome blocks download, saying it's dangerous, because publisher unknown._**

I don't sign my builds with a code certificate, as it's open source project. 
The Cheapest certificate goes around 60$ anual and unless you want to donate me for it, I will not use 
certificate for this project, there won't be any included. You can still download files, if you click 
on "arrow down" button in the red popup with warning and press "keep it".


**_My antivirus finds virus in binary file_**

This is because I use "pyinstaller" for building exe file for my project.
Python is really fast and easy language to write programs and virus developers take advantage of that.
They use the same tools, normal developers use. Like any Antivirus just flags packaging tools like "pyinstaller", as it was
used for packaging several viruses. So from their perspective, anything builded by that is virus, until it is wrong proven, which means
everytime I build new release, I need to upload my files to them and tell them to analyze it as it is "false report". It can take a lot of time, if you are not a company, but just "open source" developer.
Plus, as said above about chrome(browser blocking), I don't sign it with a certificate.
